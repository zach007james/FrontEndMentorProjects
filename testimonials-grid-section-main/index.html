        I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned 
        were current, if not more so, in the company I joined.  I 
        honestly feel I got every peeny's worth.

        "I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.  I've been looking to make a 
        transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here.  I signed up for 
        the free intro course and found it incredibly fun!  I enrolled shortly thereafter.  The next 12 
        weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life.  Since completing the course, I've 
        successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."

        recommended!

      <p class="cardQuote">
        "Before joining the bootcamp, I've 
        never written a line of code.  I needed 
        some structure from professionals 
        who can help me learn programming 
        step by step.  I was encouraged to 
        enroll by a former student of theirs 
        who can only say wonderful things 
        about the program.  The entire 
        curriculum and staff did not 
        dissappoint.  They were very hands-on 
        and I never had to wait long for 
        assistance.  The agile team project, in 
        particular, was outstanding.  It took 
        my learning to the next level in a way 
        that no turtorial could ever have.  In 
        fact, I've often referred to it during 
        interviews as an example of my 
        development experience.  It certainly 
        helped me land a job as a full-stack 
        developer after receiving multiple 
        offers.  100% recommend! "

        Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp 
        themselves.  Getting guidance from them and learning from 
        their experiences was easy.

      <p class="cardQuote">
        "The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing.  The 
        program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present 
        myself as a capable junior developer.  The standard is above the rest.  You will get the 
        personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people."
